### **Purpose**

The purpose of a budget app is to keep track of our expenses and to manage how our money is spent daily, as an international student living in Melbourne being on a budget and keeping track of how my money is coming in and out is crucial as nowadays we are all trying to get some financial education, I am a true believer that having the ambit of being on a budget is the first step for getting into financial education, a subject that no one has taught us so far. 

A budget is a financial plan that will help us to keep track of and manage our income and expenses. The main purpose of being on a budget is to ensure that we are spending our money wisely and that we are not overspending. Being on a budget makes us more aware of how our money is going out each month. This makes us prioritize different expenses and save more money for future goals. 

Being on a budget also allows us to save enough money for different goals in the future, even if it saves for a new laptop, phone, or even bigger things like paying off debt, making a down payment, or building an emergency fund, etc. It allows us to save more money than if were not on a budget.

**The perks of being on a budget are:**

* Increased financial awareness 
* Reduced financial stress 
* Improved savings 
* Achieving financial goals 
* Greater financial freedom 

Nowadays, a lot of students keep track of their expenses by doing a simple spreadsheet in Excel, which is the easiest way to keep track of your expenses however, a lot of people start lacking interest after a couple of days since it is annoying sometimes to go and grab your laptop for a better view for registering your expenses of the day, thatâ€™s why with my app a will be providing and smooth and easy way to register your expenses from each day so you can keep track of your expenses from wherever you are.
